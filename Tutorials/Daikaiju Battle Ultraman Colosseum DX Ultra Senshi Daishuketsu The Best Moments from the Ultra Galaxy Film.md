The game also has some tips and tricks that can help you improve your performance and enjoy the game more. Here are some of them:
 
- Each character has a different set of skills and abilities that can be activated by pressing certain buttons or combinations. You can check the skill list in the Customize Mode or in the pause menu during a battle. Some skills are passive and always active, while others are active and require energy or cards to use.
- You can also equip different cards to your characters to enhance their stats, skills, or abilities. You can obtain cards by playing the game, using the Data Cardass system, or entering passwords. You can change your cards in the Customize Mode or before a battle.
- Some characters have special forms or modes that can be activated by fulfilling certain conditions, such as having low health, high energy, or a specific card. For example, Ultraman Tiga can transform into Glitter Tiga by using his Glitter Tiga card when his health is below 30%. Some forms or modes have time limits or drawbacks, so use them wisely.
- Some characters have special attacks that can be unleashed by pressing the A and B buttons together when their energy is full. These attacks are very powerful and can deal massive damage to the opponent. However, they also consume all of your energy and leave you vulnerable for a while. Some attacks also require specific cards to use.
- You can also perform team attacks with your partner character by pressing the C button when your partner gauge is full. These attacks are also very powerful and can hit multiple opponents at once. However, they also consume all of your partner gauge and prevent you from switching characters for a while.
- You can switch between your main character and your partner character by pressing the Z button. This can be useful for changing strategies, avoiding attacks, or recovering health and energy. However, you cannot switch characters when your partner gauge is empty or when you are performing a team attack.
- You can also dodge attacks by pressing the direction pad twice in any direction. This can help you avoid taking damage or getting hit by special attacks. However, you cannot dodge when you are attacking or being attacked.
- You can also block attacks by holding the B button. This can reduce the damage you take from normal attacks or special attacks. However, you cannot block when you are attacking or being attacked.

By following these tips and tricks, you can master the game and have more fun with it. Daikaiju Battle Ultraman Colosseum DX Ultra Senshi Daishuketsu is a game that offers a lot of content and replay value for fans of Ultraman and kaiju.
